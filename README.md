This project was built as part of the online course by [Code4Startup.](https://code4startup.com/ai_saas/)

I followed the course to learn how to build AI-powered SaaS products using modern tools and best practices. The core implementation is based on the course, with some customizations and extensions.

Chat with PDF is an AI-powered SaaS application that enables users to upload PDF documents and engage in real-time conversations with them using integrated large language models (LLMs). It's a complete end-to-end project built with modern web technologies, vector databases, and serverless infrastructure.
